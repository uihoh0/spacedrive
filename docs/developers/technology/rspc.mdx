# rspc

We use a fork based on [rspc 0.1.4](https://docs.rs/rspc) which contains heavy modifications from the upstream.

## What's different?

- A super pre-release version of rspc v1's procedure syntax.
- Upgrade to Specta v2 prelease
- Add `Router::sd_patch_types_dangerously`
- Expose internal type maps for the invalidation system.
- All procedures must return a result
- `Procedure::with2` which is a hack to properly support the middleware mapper API
- Legacy executor system - Will require major changes to the React Native link.

Removed features relied on by Spacedrive:

- Argument middleware mapper API has been removed upstream

## Basic usage

```rust
use rspc::{alpha::AlphaRouter};

use super::{Ctx, R};

pub(crate) fn mount() -> AlphaRouter<Ctx> {
	R.router()
		// Define a library query
		.procedure("todo", {
			R.with2(library())
				.query(|(node, library), input: ()| async move {
					Ok(todo!())
				})
		})
		// Define a node query
		.procedure("todo2", {
			R.query(|node, input: ()| async move {
					Ok(todo!())
				})
		})
		// You can copy the above examples but use `.mutation` instead of `.query` for mutations

		// Define a node subscription
		.procedure("todo3", {
			// You can make this a library subscription by using `R.with2(library())`
			R.subscription(|node, _: ()| async move {
					// You can return any `impl Stream`
					Ok(async_stream::stream! {
						yield "hello";
					})
				})
		})
}

/// You merge this router into the main router defined in `core/src/api.rs`.
```

## Known bugs

### Returning an error from a procedure can cause a panic

This is due to a bug in the future that resolves requests. This was fixed [upstream in July 2023](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/rspc/commit/f115ab22e04d59b0c9056989392215df2b7bb531).

A panic will also take out the entire request which could contain a batch of multiple procedures.

This will likely cause the frontend request to hang indefinitely.

### Blocking

#### Batching

This applies to both Tauri and Axum when using the batch link (**which Spacedrive uses**). Each request within a batch is effectively run in serial. This may or may not make a major difference as the response can't be send until all items are ready but having to run them in parallel would be faster regardless.

#### Tauri

Minus batching everything is run in parallel.

#### Axum

All queries and mutations run within a single websocket connection (**which Spacedrive uses**) are run in serial.

Minus batching HTTP requests are run in parallel.

### Websocket reconnect

If the websocket connection is dropped (due to network disruption) all subscriptions _will not_ restart upon reconnecting.

This will cause the invalidation system to break and potentially other parts of the app that rely on subscriptions.

Queries and mutations done during the network disruption will hang indefinitely.
