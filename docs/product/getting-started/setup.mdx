When using the Spacedrive server you can use the `SD_AUTH` environment variable to configure authentication.

Valid values:

- `SD_AUTH=disabled` - Disables authentication.
- `SD_AUTH=username:password` - Enables authentication for a single user.
- `SD_AUTH=username:password,username1:password1` - Enables authentication with multiple users (you can add as many users as you want).

## App data

When opening Spacedrive for the first time, a data folder is created in the following location:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/spacedrive`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\spacedrive` or `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\spacedrive`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/spacedrive`

This folder contains the SQLite databases for each Library, configuration files, perma-cached thumbnail data and logs.

## Having issues?

We're still in alpha, so there are a few known issues. If you're having trouble, please check the following. You can join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/gTaF2Z44f5) server to ask for help or [report a bug on GitHub](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive/issues).

### Spacedrive is not opening

We are working on fixing this issue happening at all, but for now if Spacedrive won't open, you can try the following:

- Move and BACKUP your app data folder (explained above) to another location and try opening Spacedrive again. This likely means your app data is corrupted or outdated, if you have used a much earlier version of Spacedrive.
- Run this command to clear the local storage of the webapp:
  macOS:
  ```bash
  rm -rf "$HOME/Library/WebKit/Spacedrive" "$HOME/Library/Caches/Spacedrive" "$HOME/Library/WebKit/com.spacedrive.desktop" "$HOME/Library/Caches/com.spacedrive.desktop"
  ```
  Windows:
  ```bash
  rm -rf  "~/.local/share/com.spacedrive.desktop/" "~/.cache/spacedrive"
  ```

### Debugging

Opening Spacedrive via the command line will reveal live debug logging in your terminal.

**macOS**

```bash
~/Applications/Spacedrive.app/Contents/MacOS/Spacedrive
```

**Windows**

```bash
C:\Program Files\Spacedrive\Spacedrive.exe
