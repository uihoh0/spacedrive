Spacedrive is available as a command-line interface (CLI) tool. The CLI is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with the Spacedrive network from your terminal.

```bash
# Launch Spacedrive
spacedrive -d
```

```bash
# View help menu
spacedrive --help
```

```bash

spacedrive --info
```

### Managing Locations

At least one identifier such as `--name`, `--path` or `--id` is required for each command.

```bash
# List all Locations
spacedrive location list
```

```bash
# Add a Location
spacedrive location add /path/to/folder --name "Location Name"
```

```bash
# Remove a Location by name
spacedrive location remove --name "Location Name"
```

```bash
# Remove a Location by path
spacedrive location remove --path /local/path/to/location
```
