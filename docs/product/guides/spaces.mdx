**Spaces** are virtual folders designed to foster collaboration and organization within Spacedrive. They allow you to share, curate, and customize a collection of files from various locations, making it easy to collaborate with others or manage your content just the way you want.

### What are Spaces?

Spaces are virtual folders designed to give you control over how you organize, share, and collaborate with others. Unlike traditional folders, a Space can contain files from various locations within your library. Whether it's documents, media files, or entire folders, you can curate your Space the way you want, without moving or duplicating your content.

### Build Your Space, Your Way

Creating a Space is simple, but what you can do with it is powerful:

- **Pin Key Folders**: Start by pinning important folders to the top of your Space for easy access. These could be work files, personal projects, or shared media collections—whatever matters most to you.
- **Curate Content**: Populate your Space with files from any part of your Spacedrive library. You can mix and match files, dragging them in from different storage locations, or organizing them however you prefer.

### Sharing and Collaboration Made Easy

A big focus of Spaces is **community** and **collaboration**. Whether you’re sharing your Space with teammates, friends, or collaborators, you can easily control access:

- **Invite Collaborators**: With just a few clicks, you can share your Space with others, giving them the ability to view, edit, or add their own content.
- **Set Permissions**: Need to control who can edit what? You have full control over permissions, allowing you to manage who can make changes and who can simply view the files.

### A Space for Every Purpose

Spaces are incredibly versatile. Here are just a few ways you can use them:

- **Team Projects**: Create a collaborative Space for team members to contribute files, share ideas, and work together. Pin important folders or files for quick reference.
- **Personal Organization**: Use Spaces to organize your personal files into meaningful categories, like photography projects, design inspiration, or family photos.
- **Community Resource Sharing**: Spaces make it easy to create a shared resource hub where others can access important documents, media, or references.

### Stay Organized with Flexibility

Because Spaces pull from various parts of your library, you don’t need to move files around to keep things organized. Simply pin what you need, and your files will be available within the Space, ready for you and your collaborators to access.

Want to add more structure? Use drag-and-drop functionality to arrange files or folders within the Space. You’re in full control of how everything is displayed, giving you the freedom to build a Space that matches your workflow.

### Privacy and Security

Sharing doesn’t mean compromising on security. With Spaces, you can decide who has access to your content. You can:

- Make a Space private, accessible only to you.
- Share it with specific individuals or groups.
- Set read-only or full-edit permissions, ensuring that your files are protected while still enabling collaboration.
