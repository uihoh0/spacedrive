# Jobs

Jobs allow Spacedrive to complete a body of work; a built-in multi-threaded task management system.

Jobs can be paused, resumed, and cancelled. Spacedrive will always try to restart jobs that were cut off by a restart or shutdown of Spacedrive.

A small indicator shows in the bottom left when a job is running. Clicking it will reveal the job manager.

### Job Manager

The job manager allows you to see current jobs or expand them to see various child jobs. Jobs with only one child, such as copying a single file, will not be expandable by clicking.

Job history can be cleared by hitting the small trash icon on the job manager. Note that this will not remove any ongoing jobs.

Up to 3 jobs can run simultaneously, although this may be configurable in the future. More CPU-intensive jobs like thumbnailing and labelling have an upper limit for CPU usage that can be set in the General settings page.
