# Search

The **Search** feature in Spacedrive makes it easy to find files across your entire library. Whether you're looking for a specific file by name or using advanced filters, Search is designed to help you locate your files quickly and efficiently.

## How to Use Search

- **Shortcut Key**: Press `CMD + F` (or `CTRL + F` on Windows/Linux) to access the search bar in Locations where search is available.
- **Access Through Explorer**: You also can use Search by typing in the top bar text area in the Explorer or Overview.

## Search by File Name

Search works primarily by matching file names. Just start typing in the search bar, and results will appear as you type.

## Apply Filters

To refine your search, click the **Add Filter** button. Available filters include:

- **Location**: Search within specific folders or drives.
- **Tags**: Narrow down results by tags you've applied to files.
- **Kind**: Filter by file type (e.g., document, image, video).
- **Name**: Search by exact or partial file name.
- **Extension**: Filter by file extension (e.g., `.jpg`, `.pdf`).
- **Hidden**: Show or hide hidden files in search results.
- **Favourite**: Only display files marked as favourites.

Using multiple filters together allows you to fine-tune your search and quickly locate even the most specific files.
