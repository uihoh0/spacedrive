# Quick Preview

<Video url="/videos/Spacedrive_QuickPreview.webm" />

Quick Preview allows you to "quickly preview" a file in Spacedrive. It supports a wide and growing range of formats, providing an easy way to explore your files and data.

It can be accessed by pressing the spacebar while selected on a file, as per native behaviour for macOS.

Alternatively, you can access it from the context menu.
