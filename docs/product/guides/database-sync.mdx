# Database sync

<Notice
	type="note"
	title="WIP"
	text="This feature is not available yet, please check our [roadmap](/roadmap)."

Spacedrive Libraries are just databases shared among multiple instances. When these instances connect, either via Spacedrive Cloud or peer-to-peer, the changes to each instance's local database are synchronized.
The technical details of this process are covered in the [Developer docs](/docs/developers/architecture/sync).

Database sync is a feature that allows you to sync your library database between devices. Synchronizing happens in real-time, so you can see changes made on one device reflected on another device almost instantly.

We have been working tirelessly on this feature to make sure it is as seamless as possible. We are excited to share it with you soon.

## Sync Indicator

Alongside the job indicator, a small sync icon will appear when a sync is in progress. Clicking it will reveal the sync manager.

## Sync Manager

The sync manager allows you to see the current sync status, and any errors that may have occured. You can also see the last time a sync was completed.

## Cloud Sync

When connected to Spacedrive Cloud, a Spacedrive Instance will send its changes to be stored in the Cloud in an encrypted format.
When another instance connects to the Cloud, it will download these changes and apply them to its local database.

This process does not require multiple instances to be connected at the same time.
Spacedrive Cloud will store the changes for when other instances connect.

## Peer-To-Peer Sync

When connected over peer-to-peer, two instances will exchange their database changess directly.
The contents of the database changes are not encrypted themselves,
instead the connection between the two instances will ensure that they are encrypted during transit.
