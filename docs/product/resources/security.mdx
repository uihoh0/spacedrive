# Security

Spacedrive is currently in its alpha phase and we're focusing on enhancing its security.

### Key points to note:

- **Code Audit Pending:** A thorough code audit is planned but not yet completed.
- **Database Encryption:** Currently, the database is unencrypted at rest. We plan to implement encryption soon.
- **Data Privacy:** No file information is shared outside the app, as the device connection feature is not live yet.
- **Docker Version Caution:** The Docker version lacks authentication, meaning it's accessible on your network. This will be addressed with upcoming auth features.

Spacedrive is evolving but isn't ready for security-critical use yet. We're committed to improving security and will keep our users updated.
